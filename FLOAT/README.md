# FLOAT

FLOAT is a small VR prototype built with LÖVR that explores weightless, floating movement and basic object interaction. The experience focuses on simple physics-driven interactions suitable for rapid prototyping and VR playtesting.

## How it plays
- Use your VR controllers (or hands) to move the generated sphere and cubes.
- Move and scale the objetcs so they fit on the paltform

## Demo Video
A short recording demonstrating core mechanics is included in the repository: [media/FLOAT_demo.mp4](../media/FLOAT_demo.mp4).

## Notes
- Built as a prototype for exploring VR locomotion ideas — intended as a starting point for further design iterations.
